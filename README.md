# Welcome to my Harry Potter Quiz App!
This is an Interactive Web Apps Project created from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. 

This is a 10-question interactive quiz to test your knowledge of both the Harry Potter series movies and books. 

The live app can be found [here](https://livetodeliver.github.io/HPQuizApp). 

### Future Potential Changes/Additions

* Add a background photo (Hogwarts castle, perhaps?)
* Update CSS (change color scheme?)
* Add additional questions


*This project was completed as part of [Thinkful's Full-Stack Flex Program](https://www.thinkful.com).*
